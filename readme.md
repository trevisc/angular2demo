This is a demo by Deborah Kurata that I am using to learn Angular 2.  
I am following her videos on pluralsight:

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
